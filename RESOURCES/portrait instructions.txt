1 - Find a portrait (try to avoid ones that stare into the camera head-on, took me a bit to learn this one)
2 - Cut out the background
3 - in Paint.net, make sure you have the Drop Shadow plugin. drag the background in as a new layer on top of the portrait, resize so it looks good and there is ample margins on the top and sides
4 - in Paint.net, go to "effects -> photo -> soften portrait" and use the following settings:
	- set softness to zero
	- set lighting to twenty
	- set warmth to zero
5 - After this is done, go to "effects -> object -> drop shadow" and make sure that
	- Offset X is zero
	- Offset Y is zero
	- Widening Radius is five
	- Blur Radius is five
	- Shadow Opacity is 100
	- Color is Black
That should be it. Name it something like "Portrait_<TAG>_<NAME>.dds"
