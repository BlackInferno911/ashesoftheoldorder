## Steps for a new dev to get accommodated
1. If you're not a solely lore dev, check your email for an invite to the github repository, and if there isn't an invite then message @Aridoitsu about it and ask for one
2. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
3. Clone the repository into any folder on your PC which you want.
4. Copy the descriptor.mod file from the ashesoftheoldorder folder and paste it into the "mod" folder of HOI4, it's path should be Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod
5. Change the name of the pasted descriptor.mod file to anything you want, just make sure to not change the file extension
6. Open up the new .mod file in any text editor and add the line `path="C:/Users/YOUR PC NAME HERE/THE PATH TO THE MOD FOLDER/ashesoftheoldorder"` to the end of it
7. Open up the HOI4 launcher and select the mod, if it isn't there then @ ditto voltorb about it since he must've miswritten this guide or you made a small error
8. You've successfully installed the mod! Now that it's installed, any edit you make in the files of the mod folder (ashesoftheoldorder) can be pushed directly to the GitHub repository via GitHub Desktop

If you need any help from this point on, ask the head dev of your department what you should be doing.
