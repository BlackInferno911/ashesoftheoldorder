 ACR.1.t:0 "Tom Cotton's State of the Union"
 ACR.1.d:0 ""The deadly plague of black separatism that emerged late last year has now spread across the country. The so called 'nation' of New Afrika deceived the world- even their own people of this deadly plague\n\nHere at home, a strange and unsettling hush has fallen over much of the country, as the army secures the country and millions of Americans brace for what's to come. In Atlanta, Agusta, Columbus,  preparation for the plague has ended. The plague has arrived in force. The urgent battle to suppress it has begun." - Tom Cotton"
 ACR.1.a:0 "Hurrah!"
