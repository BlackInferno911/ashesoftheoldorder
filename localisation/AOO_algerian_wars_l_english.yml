 algerian_wars_news.1.desc:0 "News from North Africa has uncovered an uprising against the current government of Algeria. This uprising started as a group of protesters but has quickly become violent, and turbulent. The Algerian government has sent out a call for aid against the uprisings, the Algerian government is now fighting a two front war, one front against an Islamist Partisan Group centered in Hassi Messaoud, and another front against the newly proclaimed Algerian Republic centered in Bechar. Although the Algerian government currently outnumbers these uprisings, there have been suspicions that many neighbouring countries have been supporting these partisan groups, which may make this an uphill battle for Algeria. In any outcome, there will be blood shed in the deserts of Northern Africa."
