 #Events
 NAK.2.t:0 "Assess the Nation"
 NAK.2.d:0 "Born from the ashes of the dying confederacy, New Afrika was originally only an idea by a few radicals in the south. But as the harsh whip of the white man cracked closer and closer to the black man’s neck, the only reasonable action to take was to fight back. Back when there was a semblance of democracy in the confederacy, they took to the streets, only to be answered with gunfire. So they took up arms of their own, and began a gruelling 2 year long struggle for freedom. By December 17th 2017, the forces of the New Afrikan Freedom Front under Jesse Jackson controlled land from the Appalachian to the Atlantic. But the fight is far from over, no, it has only begun. "
 NAK.2.a:0 "For Freedom!"
 NAK.3.t:0 "Prepare for the Inevitable"
 NAK.3.d:0 "This uneasy peace cannot last for long, not when Confederate ships circle like sharks around our ports, blocking any trade from getting in, not when they oppress our countrymen NAKoss the border. But they are too weak to fight back against us now, and we are too weak to strike deeper into their hearts. So we must ready our arms, strengthen the barricades, and prepare ourselves for when that day comes."
 NAK.4.t:0 "Assess the Economy"
 NAK.4.d:0 "New Afrika subsides off of scraps of whatever economy existed in the area before. With little to no heavy industry to speak of, and heavily reliant on foreign aid from the AUF, New Afrika is in no shape for an all out war. Crippling homelessness, malnourishment, and lack of adequate healthcare sweep the nation. Its arms comes from garage workshops, where people haphazardly put together makeshift guns or bombs, and its heavy weaponry is scavenged from abandoned Confederate armories that they left behind during their evacuation. This must be remedied before we are ready for War. "
 NAK.4.a:0 "Noted."
 NAK.5.t:0 "Assess the Military"
 NAK.5.d:0 "New Afrika’s military is the natural progression of their Insurrectionary forces against the Confederacy. Most of its soldiers are veterans battle hardened from years of guerrilla warfare, ready to defend New Afrika no matter the cost. They know the land they will fight on, and are always one step ahead of the confederates. Due to its nature, the New Afrikan military is severely lacking in heavy weaponry, air support, and armor. If an invasion were to occur, the most optimal way would be to fight a 1776-esque guerrilla campaign against the Confederacy."
 NAK.6.t:0 "Assess the Poltiical Situation"
 NAK.6.d:0 "While New Afrika has put aside its differences to fight the invader, internal divisions still exist. Among the High Command, the Radical Socialists believe that the best way to deal with the Confederacy is through a quick, decisive strike to demoralize them and secure a peace deal at Birmingham with a gun pressed to Cotton’s head. The Liberal Faction, however, believes in the continuation of the guerilla campaign is the only way to fight back against the superior forces of the Confederacy, and make the war too costly for them to continue it, forcing a peace treaty. On the home front, racial tensions threaten to tear the young nation apart, as many whites feel uneasy about living in “New Afrika” and being ruled by mostly African Americans, It is vital to calm the entire country down, to ensure there is no white sympathy for the confederacy, or even worse, an insurrection from them."
