# Events
 IAI.1.t:0 "15th UNITY-PACT CONVENTION"
 IAI.1.d:0 "Politicians nervously attended to their various business about in the State Capitol Building, which was the centre of Iowan politics. However the stressful environment was being perpetuated by one event in particular, the 15th and final Unity-Pact Convention. The Unity-Pact was an agreement signed by the pre-collapse politicians of Iowa and the Midwestern Federal Forces in Iowa, who have now turned into the Unity-Guard. When Iowa was a brand-new state that was defined by chaos and uncertain and fluid borders, the Unity-Guard was formed and became more and more popular amongst the population as they stabilised the front-lines with the other warlords and kept Iowa safe and secure, the politicians were eventually forced to co-operate with them, however the Unity-Pact Government protocols have expired and only fate and the Iowan people will determine the electorate."
 IAI.1.a:0 "Iowa's Flaming Vanguard, the Unity-Guard and the Iowan Fascist Party!"
 IAI.1.b:0 "The Old Order will forever burn on! The Liberal-Conservative Coalition Party!"
