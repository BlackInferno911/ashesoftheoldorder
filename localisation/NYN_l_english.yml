 albany.1.d:0 "“Unit 1, we’ve got a report of another riot about to break out on Church Street going onto Walnut. We’ve got officers stationed there already but we need reinforcements.”\n\n“Heard ya loud and clear. We’ll be pulling onto 6th to stop any further movement.”\n\nAs the second cop cruiser approached the scene of the protest, the chanting cries could be heard before the speakers could be seen. “Zerickbringe unser land! Zerickbringe unser land!” It was still surprising to the local government that the protesting would continue through the winter.\n\nStopped by officers on both sides, a sound reminiscent of a pistol filled the street before the hissing of a tear gas canister fell in the middle of the group of protesters. The muffled shouting of an officer could be heard over the yelling and the police officers on both ends of the street started moving inwards on the protesters, using their service-issued rifles to knock the protesters to the ground as well as liberally using pepper spray on the ones who could still breath through the combination of tear gas and the cold, dry air. After being pushed to the ground, the officers would hold the protesters against the wet pavement, some of the more audacious police using their steel-toed boots to hold the protesters’ heads to the ground, and put both their hands in handcuffs, to later be sent to the Lehigh County Prison as political prisoners.\n\nOutside of the box that the officers had formed around the protesters being arrested, the friends and family of the protesters involved could be heard crying and shouting to the ones arrested, some even trying to get through the barricade of policemen, though their actions were met with the same treatment as the protesters inside the box."
